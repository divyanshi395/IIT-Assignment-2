    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

    <h2>
        Overview
    </h2>

    <p>
        This project is a discord pad. Essentially it is a keyboard to perform actions on Discord to make using the platform easier and quicker. It will use Discord’s API to determine a user’s most used emotes and recently opened conversations and servers to automatically create shortcuts for the user within Discord. It will be a keyboard with LCD screens on each key so that these things can change and so that emotes that are animated can stay animated. It will come in two variations - a 78-key flagship model for the Discord enthusiasts and a smaller 28-key mini version for those that require less actions or just want to save some desk space.

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This project is essentially a discord pad, a keyboard to make using discord easier. The thought is that it would come in two variations, the flagship 78-key version and the smaller 28-key mini version. The 78-key variant would be a 6x13-key keyboard and the 28-key variant would be a 4x7, made up entirely of LCD screens. The keyboard would be run by a software that would connect with Discord’s API to bring customised buttons to each user, which is why the LCD screens are needed. On top of this, the software would allow the keyboard to be fully customisable for the user if they preferred to make their own buttons. This keyboard would have the option to be either standing upright and facing the user or to be laying down on the desk. It would plug into the computer via a USB-A cable and have a USB-C input to allow for easy fixes when wires break as well as customisation.
    </p>

    <h3>The default buttons</h3>

    <p>
        In Discord, when opening the emote menu, the 42 most frequently used emotes of the user are shown. As such, this Discord keypad would show all 42 of these on the 78-key variant and the twelve most used on the 28-key variant. All animated emotes would stay animated on these LCD screens. When a user pushes one of these emote buttons, the emote will be inserted into the text box of the chat that the user has open at that moment. There would also be an option within the software which sends the emote right away when the button is pressed rather than the user having the user have to push the enter button which users can turn on if they so desire. If the discord window is not open or not active, it would activate the discord window and the emote would be entered into the open conversation/server channel if there is one. If there is no open conversation or server channel, no emote would be entered as it would be recognised as just a misclick.
        <br>
        <br>
        Next to the emotes, but separated by a gap, would be a user’s most recent conversations. On the larger version there would be twelve of the user’s most recent conversations and on the mini version there would be four. This section includes any private conversations/direct messages and any group chats that aren’t classified as whole servers. The button would show a picture of the other person or the group chat picture. When one of these buttons is pressed, it would take the user directly to this conversation. If the Discord window was not open or not active, it would activate the window and then take the user to the conversation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Next to these, separated by another small gap, would be the recent servers that a user has visited. These would operate very similarly to the recent conversation buttons in that they would display a picture of the server icon and when you press on them they take you directly to that server. Since servers have multiple channels, these buttons would take a user to their most recently opened channel in that server. As with the conversation buttons, if the discord window is not open or not active, an instance of discord will be activated to then take the user to the server. Like the conversation buttons, on the 78-key variant there would be twelve of these buttons and on the 28-key there would be just four.
        <br>
        <br>
        To the right of the recent servers buttons would be all the buttons relating to calls. The buttons included in this section on the 78-key variant would be: start discord call, end discord call, answer discord call, decline discord call, mute user and deafen user. Each would have an icon on the LCD screen, eg. start call would have a phone icon, mute would have the microphone icon with a slash through it etc. The start discord call button would change to a “toggle video sharing” when in a call, as this button would otherwise be useless when a user is in a call. As for how these buttons would operate, the start call button would start a call with the open conversation, if there is no open conversation, no call will be started. The end call button will work on any conversation call or voice channel that a user is currently in. The answer and decline buttons are pretty self explanatory and the mute and deafen buttons will also work in any discord call or voice channel a user is in. On the 28-key variant however, there would be just 4 buttons: start call, which would also double as a video toggle button; end call; mute user; and deafen user. The answer and decline buttons would not be included as to save space but could be changed around by the user at the expense of other buttons if they wanted to.
        <br>
        <br>
        Next to these buttons would be the status and settings buttons. Discord currently has four different statuses that a user can choose from: online, idle, do not disturb and invisible. So, on the 78-key variant the three that are not currently assigned to a user would be on the first three buttons of this column so that when a user presses them their status will change to the one they have pressed. These buttons will have the icon that discord uses to indicate these status, ie. the crescent moon for idle, green dot for online etc. The three buttons below these would be a settings button, represented by the cog as Discord represents it, a close/launch discord button, represented by discord’s logo itself, and then a launch button for the software that the keyboard will use to operate where a user can edit the keybinds which will be represented by the logo of the software. On the mini variant however, there would only be four buttons: change status, discord settings, close/open discord and the keyboard software program. When the change status button is pressed, three of the four buttons in this column would change to the statuses that the user does not currently have equipped and the final button would be a cancel button to get out of that menu.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the user is perhaps a new Discord user and maybe doesn’t have enough recently used emotes or conversations or servers to fill the board, these will show up as blank buttons which the user can fill in with other buttons. However, this is unlikely to be a common occurrence as this keyboard will be marketed towards the frequent Discord users and on top of this there will also be the mini version which doesn’t have as many keys to fill up.

    </p>

    <h3>Customisation options</h3>

    <p>
        As previously mentioned, all of these buttons would be entirely customisable by the user if they so please. Some options of what they could change the buttons to would be: 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">
        - Any emote they choose, rather than just their most used
        <br>
        <br>
        - A “reactions” button which would allow a user to press the react button and then press an emote to react with that emote to either the last message in the open conversation or server channel, or the message that their mouse is hovering over, depending on the settings they choose
        <br>
        <br>
        - Specific conversations or servers, rather than their recently opened
        <br>
        <br>
        - The top servers in their list of servers rather than recently opened
        <br>
        <br>
        - A share screen and share video button for Discord calls which would act in a toggling manner in that when a user presses it, it will show video/share the screen if the user is not already or turn it off if they are
        <br>
        <br>
        - Specific active statuses rather than the ones not currently in use, this could free up some extra space for other buttons
        <br>
        <br>
        - Macros
    </p>

    <h3>Macros</h3>

    <p>
        As part of the software that comes with the keyboard, users will be able to make macros for Discord within the program. For example, if they wanted to be able to open up to a specific conversation or server and send a specific emote, they would be able to create this.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
        Emotes are one of Discord’s most used features however, the time it takes to have to write out your whole emote when you want to communicate quickly with someone can get frustrating. This is what inspired this project, the idea to have all your frequently used emotes at the tips of your fingers. In the same vein, there are so many other discord processes that could be sped up, which is appealing to a lot of what Discord’s current market is: gamers. Being in the middle of a game and having to switch over to discord to communicate with your friends can be irritating. When you have to send a message to someone or mute your microphone, that is a lot of time in-game where someone could shoot you or something along those lines. This keyboard could potentially remove that possibility by speeding up all the processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools and technologies</h2>

    <p>
        The software required would be the user interface which would allow the user to customise their experience with the Discord keyboard. It would allow changing of buttons and other settings but most importantly it would connect to Discord’s API so that the keyboard can be automatically tailored to the user. The hardware required would be the keyboard itself including: the LCD keys, the body of the keyboard, the PCB inside and the cable to connect it to the computer. The keyboard would also come with a stand so that it could be upright, facing the user. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        Skills required
    </h2>

    <p class="lastparagraph">
        Skills required would include the software to make the user interface for customisability and connection to Discord. Finding people with the skills required for this wouldn’t be too difficult as connecting with Discord’s API and making a UI for keyboard firmware are things that have been done numerous times and aren’t too complex in the bigger scope of things. Most of the actions that the keyboard would perform would essentially be macros which would be relatively easy to formulate. In terms of hardware, the LCD keys aren’t too common however they have been done before so they are very possible. This would, I assume, be the main feat of the hardware side of things. Making the PCB and firmware for the keyboard are standard for any keyboard so these skills would be pretty easy to find.
