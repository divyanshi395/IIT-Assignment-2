    <h1>Machine Learning and AI</h1>
        <p>     <p>
 Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps software applications predict outcomes more accurately. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning. Other common uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection, business process automation (BPA), and predictive maintenance. There is a wide number of uses of machine learning in 2022.
 Some of them are: 
•	Unsupervised machine learning
•	No code machine learning and less code machine learning developments
•	Automated machine learning
•	Machine learning operationalization management
In unsupervised machine leaning, algorithms are designed to identify groups and patterns in unseen data, so no human intervention is required. This type of learning allows you to look at the data and see similarities. This is ideal for businesses looking to implement cross-selling plans. Unsupervised machine learning also uses cluster analysis methods that scan data to find groups. Use K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
No-code is becoming more and more popular among enterprises. DataRobot, Clarifai and Teachable Machines are all platforms that allow companies to work without engineers and developers. These platforms allow users to create their own tools using a drag-and-drop interface without the need for complex coding. Using these platforms saves a lot of money and time by requiring less technical knowledge and writing less code. Too many business analysts lack the necessary software coding and programming skills, making no-code and low-code applications increasingly necessary to solve analytical problems. Even experienced machine learning engineers can develop machine learning solutions using low-code applications. Automatic machine learning automates traditional, manual processes such as data labeling. Anyone can access his AutoML with the added benefit of reducing human error. Almost every step in this process is automated. This is great because we no longer spend too much time analyzing and modeling data. Semi- and self-supervised learning helps with the need to label data without continuing to spend money on human annotators by minimizing manually labeled data.
Machine learning operationalization management focuses on the efficiency of machine learning models during the deployment and maintenance phases. Data scientists and operations can collaborate as quickly as possible. This method will help solve the problem of weak communication.
 Machine learning algorithms have been around for decades, but they're gaining new popularity as artificial intelligence gains traction. In particular, deep learning models power today's most advanced AI applications. To do. Machine learning platforms are one of the most competitive areas of enterprise technology, with most of the major vendors such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM providing platform services across various machine learning activities such as data collection and data preparation. are struggling to attract customers. Data classification, model building, training, and application deployment. The machine learning platform wars will only intensify as machine learning becomes more critical to business operations and AI becomes more practical in enterprise environments. Ongoing research into deep learning and AI is increasingly focused on developing more general applications. Today's AI models require extensive training to create highly optimized algorithms to perform their tasks. But some researchers are looking for ways to make the model more flexible, looking for techniques that would allow the machine to apply the context it learned from one of her tasks to another task in the future. 

Machine learning has an impact on almost every aspect of our daily lives.
•	How we do business?
Enterprises use machine learning in many ways. Nearly all modern businesses around the world are using AI to gather better data about their customer base. This provides insights that will enable businesses to offer their customers a personalized experience based on their personal preferences. Companies can provide content, advertisements, and even new products based on the information collected. Businesses are finding ways to not only personalize content for their customers but also use machine learning to automate routine tasks. From sending emails to automating social media accounts, machine learning is driving the marketing world.

•	Social Media? Business owners have found that online forum ratings, comments, and posts impact brand value. Many of them are looking for ways to regulate negative comments about their business online. Because these comments often have the biggest impact. Facebook itself uses AI to "proactively detect" negative content. We don't know exactly what the algorithm is looking for (Facebook keeps this information private), but we do know that it flags posts that fall into one of the following categories: nudity, Violence, Terrorism, Hate Speech, Spam, Fake Accounts, and Suicide Prevention. From there, the content is manually reviewed by humans who can verify the validity of the flag and take action. AI eliminates the need to manually review all content. Social media attention, especially negative attention, can have a significant impact on company's bottom line. When Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 caught fire and went viral on social media, the company lost his 30 points in the stock market. Companies are not necessarily asking to remove these negative comments. Rather, we want to be more transparent with our customer base by posting statements and responding to negative comments in an official capacity. Social media monitoring tracks important information about customers, helping businesses to draw more accurate conclusions about their customers' needs. Social media is a gold mine for businesses and marketers when it comes to market research. By measuring customer interest and satisfaction based on what consumers share, comment, and more, marketers can help businesses better tailor services and offers to their consumer base and optimize campaigns You can get an idea on how to do it. real time. For example, if Joe B. Consumer tweeted that he needed a new pair of shoes, and had liked, followed, and browsed clothing companies in the past, he would target various social media sites in his feed. You may start running targeted ads. Get company in shoes. These ads are also based on Joe's demographic (20-30 year old male, sports enthusiast). He may receive ads specific to athletic shoes, along with supplemental items such as team jerseys and baseball caps.
•	Finance?
Machine learning is also having a major impact on finance. Imagine credit card company or bank employees having to manually screen and evaluate the thousands of transactions that occur each day. There's no way to find something out of the norm in time to stop them cheating.By the time they catch something, the damage will be severe. But AI can detect anomalies. Although anomaly detection is still in its infancy, with new platforms being actively developed and improved, behavioral anomalies can be detected by running datasets through detailed computational analysis, a process that defines the parameters of normal behavior. Make it discoverable later. By monitoring data and statistics, AI can alert consumers faster than a fully staffed team of humans. There is also an increasing use of machine learning to improve credit scores for those with limited credit data. This allows even those with little or no credit to improve their credit score in the most efficient way by paying their phone bills, rent and utilities in a timely manner. Updates to the FICO scoring formula and VantageScore 4.0 system use AI and machine learning to use credit activity data to reflect creditworthiness more accurately. AI can recognize spending patterns and even help individuals manage their money. Budgeting apps such as Mint, Acorn and You Need a Budget (YNAB) can take a snapshot of your finances and suggest appropriate budgets based on your usual spending and income.
•	Enhanced Healthcare?
 Hospitals and clinics may soon put their health in the hands of AI. Medical professionals are using machine learning to reduce the number of accidents involving patients in their care and the incidence of nosocomial infections such as sepsis (a life-threatening bacterial infection in the blood). It aggregates and analyzes patient data to find patterns and outcomes from similar cases, enabling doctors and medical staff to predict potential problems and take prompt preventive action. Artificial intelligence will also enable the collective analysis of genetic disease data and studies, collating them into a more manageable set of information that doctors and researchers can use to better understand genetic diseases. helps. Until now, medical professionals had to go through pages of crude, handwritten, obscure data to retrieve patient medical information. Everything was done manually and everything had to be done before a patient could be treated, which was time consuming. Now, medical professionals can get real-time information and treatment insights based on a patient's medical history and current symptoms. This data comes from electronic health records and can be augmented with wearable health devices such as FitBits and Apple Watch. In fact, a man's life was saved when doctors were able to use heart rate data from a fitness tracker to inform treatment decisions in an emergency. , can help reduce errors, predict potential reactions, design vaccines that prevent potential disease outbreaks, and reduce overall healthcare costs for patients and providers. With the power of AI and machine learning, by analyzing the vast amounts of information that a human would take a lifetime to organize and collating it into digestible datasets, doctors and researchers can use that information for research and development. can be used directly to While some of these advances are yet to be seen, there is no doubt that this machine learning and AI will change the way we look at healthcare.

Much of the public perception of artificial intelligence focuses on unemployment, but that concern probably needs to be restated. Every time a disruptive new technology comes along, we see market demand shifting to specific jobs. For example, looking at the auto industry, many manufacturers like GM have moved to his EV production in line with their environmental commitments. The energy economy is not going away, but the energy source is shifting from low fuel consumption to electricity. We should look at artificial intelligence as well, which will shift job demand to other areas. As data grows and changes daily, you need people to help manage these systems. Industries most likely to be impacted by changing job demands still need resources to address more complex issues. B. Customer Service. Key aspects of artificial intelligence and its impact on the labor market will support individuals in their transition into these new market demand areas.
Machine learning makes it easier for us to connect with the outside world.  In social media, we can see machine learning and artificial intelligence have an enormous impact. From recommending tweets to combating inappropriate or racist content, to improving the user experience, Twitter has started using artificial intelligence behind the scenes to improve its products. It processes large amounts of data through deep neural networks and learns user preferences over time. Deep learning is helping Facebook tap into a larger portion of the unstructured dataset created by its nearly two billion people who update his status 293,000 times a minute. Most of its deep learning technology is based on the Torch framework, which focuses on deep learning technology and neural networks. Instagram also uses big data and artificial intelligence to target ads, fight to cyberbully, and remove offensive comments. As the amount of content on platforms increases, artificial intelligence is essential to presenting information that platform users may like, fighting spam, and improving the user experience. The chatbot recognizes words and phrases and (hopefully) provides useful content to customers asking frequently asked questions. Chatbots are so accurate that they can sometimes look like you are talking to a real person. Now, we have digital assistants on our phones, tablets, and computers. Apple's Siri, Google Now, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana are digital assistants that help you with tasks ranging from checking your schedule and searching the web to sending commands to other apps. AI is an important part of how these apps work because it learns from every user interaction. If anyone talked about digital assistance 10 years back, it would have sounded like something that is out of a comic book. Now, we have self-driving and parking vehicles. Self-driving and parking cars use deep learning, a subset of AI, to recognize the space around a vehicle. Technology company Nvidia uses AI to give cars “the power to see, think, and learn, so they can navigate a nearly infinite range of possible driving scenarios,”. The company’s AI-powered technology is already in use in cars made by Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volvo, and Tesla, and is sure to revolutionize how people drive and enable vehicles to drive themselves. AI is definitely making the everyday life of consumers very easy. </p>
