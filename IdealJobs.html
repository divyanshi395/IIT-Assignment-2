    <h2>Similarities and differences between our ideal jobs</h2>
    <p>When comparing the ideal jobs of our team members we can see that the majority of the ideal jobs are within the IT sector. Some similarities between our ideal jobs is the annual wage, we have chosen careers that have an annual wage of $100,000 plus which indicates that part of our decision making is based financially. Georgie’s and Divyanshi’s ideal jobs are similar in some ways as both jobs require their applicants to have knowledge on coding languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
    <p>A responsibility which is similar between Johnny and Divyanshis’ ideal jobs is providing thought out and in depth analysis on their respective industries. As both are analysts, they are required to do in depth analysis on their respectives markets and outline trends within those markets and provide their clients with the most clear and on point data so that their clients are able to prosper from the information given.</p>
    <p>One similarity that everyone has within their job is knowledge and experience, this outlines what is required from us to get a chance to have the opportunity to work in our ideal jobs. Johnny is required to have knowledge and experience in understanding the market, Georgie and Divyanshi need to have knowledge on coding languages and Asfandyar needs to have knowledge and experience in software engineering. This showcases how hard each one of us needs to work to get our ideal job. </p>
    <p>As there are similarities between our ideal jobs, there will also be differences as most of us have chosen jobs that are within the IT sector however have different roles and priorities. The odd one out within our group would be Johnny as he has chosen a job that is not necessarily seen as a job within the IT sector, his ideal job is a Investment Analysis which requires him to have knowledge on the financial market and provide in depth analysis on financial assets to his clients which does not correlate with the other team members who are required to have knowledge such as coding language and server development skills.</p>
    <p>Georgies roles and priorities are no doubt unique to her position as being an IT consultant her duties reside in being able to develop and test websites and servers through coding languages such as HTML and CSS, her ideal job is also a full time position requiring her to work 8 hours a day. This is relatively different when compared to other members within the group such as Asfandyar whose ideal job is being a Software Engineer, being a Software Engineer at Hello Fresh consist of but not limited to being able to improve code within their systems, coaching and mentoring other team members and developing new products for the business. Unlike Georgie who is looking for a full time position which involves 8 hours a day of work, Hello Fresh provides a hybrid schedule which allows Asfandyar to have a flexible schedule allowing him to improve on his work/life balance. </p>
    <p>Gazis’ Ideal job is relatively different from the other members within the group. As his ideal job is a database administrator, his responsibilities involve consulting with major firms and providing them with the data necessary to maximise their profits. When compared to the others who are required to create and maintain servers, Gazi’s ideal job is similar is Johnny’s as they are both required to consult their clients in a way to maximise their clients profits. </p>
    <p>Tanmay's ideal job is within the architectural sector. This requires him to be able to analyse business needs and customer problems, establish technical needs and find cost effective solutions. This is obviously different to the others within the group as Tanmay is not required to do any in-depth IT work such as creating servers, using coding languages nor maintaining company systems. </p>
