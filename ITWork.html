    <h1>IT Work</h1>

    <h2>Software Developer</h2>

    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>

    <p>
        Both of the creators of these videos are software developers. Justin is a web developer and Kenny doesn’t mention what specific area of software development he is in but rather talks about his general experience in the software engineering field.
    </p>

   <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>

    <p>Both creators, on a day-to-day basis, generally only interact with the other members of their development team, such as the product manager, designers, quality assurance and the other programmers on their team, but even these interactions are few throughout the day. According to them, most of their time is spent alone doing individual work.</p>

    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
    
    <p>Seemingly, they spend most of their time writing code, fixing bugs and testing other developers on their team’s codes, with a few meetings sprinkled in here and there. Justin works from home and as such spends his whole day at his desk at home coding and communicating with fellow programmers. Kenny describes that he spent a short amount of time in morning meetings with his team and then the rest at a desk coding.</p>

    <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>

    <p>Kenny makes it out like the most challenging aspect of his job was writing code to fix bugs, which he admits can get very dull and frustrating at times, only to have it torn to shreds by quality assurance team members as well as other programmers on his team. Justin doesn’t mention which aspects of his job might be difficult but he looked most stressed when a code he tried to run failed, so I can only assume that it might be this.</p>


    <h2>Tech product manager</h2>

    </p>

    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>

    <p>Tech product managers are responsible for ensuring IT projects run smoothly. They essentially are the communicators between developers and clients. They listen to clients and customers about what their wants and needs are and then communicate this to developers and designers so that they can effectively address them.</p>

    <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>

    <p>In both of the videos, the product managers talk about and show themselves interacting with many different people during their day. These include the developers, designers, clients and other stakeholders.</p>

    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>

    <p>The main task of the product managers’ jobs is to communicate with all the involved parties of an IT project and as such they spend most of their time in meetings and responding to messages, but also spend some time doing planning alone. Eve works from home and therefore does not have to spend any time in the office. Chloe’s video rather showcases the general roles of a tech product manager and so doesn’t show where she works much.</p>

    <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>

    <p>From these videos, it seems as though the planning is the most challenging part as there is so much to be done and so many different parties to coordinate with that it takes some very skillful time management to get it done.</p>

    <h2>Systems administrator</h2>

    </p>

    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>

    <p>These IT professionals are systems administrators, which is the people responsible for updating and maintaining large computer systems and networks. They deal with servers, networks, computer hardware and software, databases and much more. </p>

    <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>

    <p>Both videos talk about and show that while this job does require a lot of individual work, systems administrators also have to interact with many people throughout their day. Both Henok and Christoph talk about having to respond to tickets made by users in their organisations, and while Henok doesn’t show it in his video, Christoph mentions that he has to attend many meetings throughout his day to stay up to date with everything happening in the system.</p>

    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>

    <p>They both spend most of their time at their desk doing individual work, however the actual work they do varies from day to day as the job is so varied. Henok works from home everyday while Christoph didn’t mention what kind of setting he worked in.</p>

    <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>

    <p>It seems as though the most challenging aspect of their job is balancing and prioritising different tasks. Being systems administrator, many different queries get brought up to them each day and so obviously trying to get all them done and priortise them correctly is important.</p>

    <h2>IT Support</h2>

    <h3>Videos:</h3>

    <p class="videos">

    </p>

    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>

    <p>Both of these IT professionals are IT Support Technicians. Essentially, their job is to provide any IT help needed to users in their organisation. This is generally done through a ticketing system as showcased in both videos. They also maintain software and hardware and ensure everything IT-related stays up to date. For example, the second video showcases replacing users’ computers which have become slow.</p>

    <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>

    <p>IT support technicians will generally interact mainly with the users in their organisation as most of their job is fixing IT issues with this organisation. However, as shown in the second video, they do also have to interact with people outside of their organisation sometimes, such as computer hardware suppliers.</p>

    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>

    <p>Both videos show the IT professionals spending most of their time at their desks, but of course they also spend some of their time physically interacting with coworkers and have to go to users’ desks to fix some technical issues. Chris, in the first video, also mentions that he can work either from the office or from home, and often times has to work at home if they are planning after-hours maintenance.</p>

    <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>

    <p>Neither video touches on the difficult aspects of this job very much, but based on what I saw, it seems that diagnosing and debugging tickets is an aspect which sometimes requires a bit of extra work and thinking.</p>

    <h2>Cyber-security</h2>

    <h3>Videos:</h3>

    <p class="videos">

    </p>

    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>

    <p>While both creators work in cybersecurity, each of them works in a different field. Chantelle, the woman in the first video, works in cybersecurity awareness and as such her job is to make sure that the people in her organisation stay alert and aware to various cybersecurity threats. Nicole, from the second video, however, is a security engineer, which means she implements and maintains security features for her organisation.</p>

    <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>

    <p>Both women generally only interact with people inside their organisation. Chantelle mentions that it’s only her and her manager on her team and then communicates with users inside her organisation about their cybersecurity habits. Nicole similarly only really talks about communicating with internal staff members for her job. Being an engineer, Nicole especially would have close contact with the software developers so that they can make the security features she and her team design.</p>

    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>

    <p>Both professionals spend most of their time at their desks doing individual work, in meetings or communicating with other members of the organisation. Chantelle works entirely remotely and Nicole doesn’t mention whereabouts she works from.</p>

    <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>

    <p class="lastparagraph">Chantelle mentions in her video that the most challenging parts of her job are the most mundane tasks, namely her start and end of day BAU tasks, which is essentially just checking whether people have done training that they need to and emailing them if they haven’t. Nicole mentions that one of the difficult tasks in her job is troubleshooting when certain features don’t work or when there are false alarms.</p>
