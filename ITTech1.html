    <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
        <p>
            Autonomous vehicles are like a space program but for the road, to elaborate like in a space program the main agenda is to enter & exit the threshold of the earth safely and enter or orbit other space bodies to bring back Intel that can be useful in various ways, this automotive program aims to achieve complete self-driving and all vehicles become tech-oriented yet the tech solely focuses on making it more reflexive and safer to the Ecosystem it’s released in, which in this case is earth. There are five levels of autonomous vehicles; Levels zero and one are no automation & driver’s assistance respectively, Levels two and three are partial and conditional driving, and Level four which also considered the most important goal to solve one of the biggest challenges of this generation which is autonomous driving is Full Automation provided with maps and directions that are pre-loaded, and the fifth level being full independence which is even if you leave the car in Afghanistan it will come back where it belongs completely on Its own. The vision is basically to make a car do everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            Waymo, cruise & aurora are examples of using simulation and robotaxi as real-world data to test out and tweak the flaws in semi-autonomous driving, to make sure it eliminates the chances of a crash as much as possible, being scientifically & practically correct the car cannot avoid natural calamities but it will reduce accidents and the idea to have less & fewer people own a car for daily uses which according to me is to minimise pollution & exploitation of the environment due to ignorance of vehicle-based activities, but if the goal is to leave the car in Afghanistan & the car will self-drive has to be sure that the car knows EVERYTHING from how to fix the engines to any technical issues that may occur. it has to be a link between every single technicality that goes into the work of the drivers, mechanics, fuel pumps, traffic police, etc. These have been divided into three parts which are driver-centric, network-centric, and Vehicle-centric (Researching, Developing, and testing in respective industries). Because realistically technical issues are bound to occur and then it will just be a race to who has fewer numbers of autonomous technical accidents.
        </p>

        <p>
            There have been a total of 392 crashes out of which Tesla was responsible for 273 of them in 11 months. There is a global conflict of interest between AVs being safer than human-driven cars. FSD is currently available as an add-on service for $15,000 or a monthly subscription fee of $199 from Tesla. The feature is still in beta mode, and a licensed driver is still required to monitor the vehicle but the tech industry is not without its battles as the release of the beta version of full self-drive mode might also be hindered due to Tesla being sued over autopilot & full self-driving and also false advertising which is a class action lawsuit. Elon musk disagrees with 70% of Americans who find Avs completely unsafe and irrational. But even if the public opposes it, it's a bigger picture that will create remarkable global change and improve safety as we know it. General Motors is leading the way with their Super Cruise system, but they are not alone; Ford, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are all attempting to replicate it.
        </p>

        <p>
            AVs are also tackling supply chain challenges & is being promoted on truckers will get to sleep at night and the end number of gruesome deaths will be avoided- this is where it comes down to the legal framework that the safety protocol has to be carefully monitored, this will tackle a huge problem of stolen goods, late night accidents, rash driving. 55% of small businesses believe in having an autonomous fleet in two years. TuSimple and Aurora motor vehicle manufacturers are free to certify for themselves that a feature is safe. The NHTSA steps in if new features turn out to be a safety hazard because Providing guard rails at the federal level is helpful because any safety hazard has to be reasoned with, corrected, and then only tested upon so to see the bigger picture even if it's hard to trust it's safe to be on the same road and worksite of an AI run truck or car. NHTSA is reliable as it made Tesla change a feature in the full-self-driving mode which is currently allowed to commercialise its beta version. Radar interference, visibility problems, traffic & road are still major problems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            According to some noticeable developments made in the last three years Companies like Aurora can use this powerful capability to create interactive scenarios for the system to learn from and test against by investing early in simulation. Developers can run massive simulations and quickly iterate on technology before it hits the road. Indeed, we estimate that our daily simulation tests are the equivalent of driving 47 round trips to the moon. The real-life testing to overcome legal and safety 3will be based on reacting to situations like a child running in the middle of the road and reducing human error like over-speeding, and reckless driving as it accounts for as much as 94% of all road accidents and not as much on the subscribers of cutting-edge tech but rather the real value case for customers in terms of safety enhancements, time returned to the driver, and operating stress eliminated.

            Mercedes-Benz has the world’s first level 3 Approval and has been running production in Germany. Ford’s Cruise & Super Cruise runs its level 2 car production in Japan. It takes approximately 3-4 years to cross one level of automation, imperfectly but yet close to completion, Elon musk said "I get late sometimes but I deliver" and with deeper investments in the current year, I think the timelines set by Tesla to reach full self-driving by next May (2023) will take at least 3-4 more years and that’s also only possible if tech & car companies keep competing for the same goal. There have been huge unrealistic milestones that have already been achieved The system designed by general motors is to ultimately deliver hands-free driving on 3.2 million miles of roadway — nearly every inch of paved road in the United States and Canada and China has started developing cars that can reach 143 mph by levitating 35mm.

            The global impact of autonomous DRIVING will be vast. The Car insurance companies will shift from insurance due to deaths caused by human errors and rather ensure insurance against technical failures. An increase in safety levels & during commutes will be observed and AVs have the potential to reduce motor vehicle deaths by 90% and save approximately $190 billion P.An as Health care costs. It will also promote a more relaxed lifestyle by saving an ample amount of travel time and the chaos of commuting. Development in the industries like mining and farming as delivery services of goods and raw materials will become a very affordable, safe, and lower risk of loss industry. Carbon dioxide emissions will be controlled as well. It is predicted that autonomous vehicles will soon become a reality, the timeline suggests that 12 million Fully autonomous vehicles and 18 million partially autonomous vehicles will comprise 25% of the car market by 2035 generating potentially $77 billion. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has the power to review new technology before it is used in aircraft.

            New Gen Tech means complete data-based analysis to create a global influence they need to dominate global usage of the tech in real life like the Appolo go company plans to expand autonomous Robo-taxis in 65 cities in three years and 100 by the next 5 years. that's a global influence, for it to make more sense here is an example; Although China is not the largest country by land area, it is the most populous (1.3 billion people). In China, approximately 102 cities have a population of more than a million people, with approximately ten cities having a population of more than ten million people. Over the last three decades, the urban population has increased by more than half a billion, resulting in the formation of mega-cities. The government plans to have more than half of the population living in urban areas by 2020 encouraging China's rapid urbanisation. Asia comprises 60% of the world's population and China comprises 18.47% of the world's population. having over 100 cities and a few mega-cities due to the uncontrolled population but the vision is to have most people live in these mega-cities in the coming years and this is why the autonomous vehicle market will boom as people living in organised and tech-dominated mega-cities will want an autonomous vehicle in one way or another. There is a growing importance of digitization in the automotive industry. The job roles are revolutionising more than ever and this requires continuous skill-sharpening and deskilling of existing employees at the same time, to call them a tech-literate workforce.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            According to me, there will be a loss of Menial jobs that require skills like driving only, and instead, people would be encouraged to study and enter the tech industry reducing illiteracy, seasonal unemployment & poverty. All technological developments and safety improvements trickle down to all us non-tech ordinary people making general life safer so we should use our saved time to help the world excel in the future. After all, it’s all about developing futuristic tech into a completely user-friendly consumer product or a service that’s so abundant it becomes reasonable.

            Autonomy in vehicles would surely bring great productivity and procrastination change in our lives, obesity could take unpredictable heights for obvious reasons. There will be less road sense among youngsters as they would not know how to drive. But there will always be challenges corresponding to technological and economical changes. I can’t think of a surprising problem among me and my family members or friends but the fact that I can’t shake is how the car enthusiast’s culture will grow exponentially, the number of manual premium cars will rise and the modifications among cars will be massive because most companies would have a relationship with one of the autonomous tech companies which would result in tech-modifications as well. In my opinion the future jobs will be harder for people who aren’t associated with STEM. IT has the potential of maximum employment. One more interesting question is what will Robotic Automation  do to Formula1. F1 is the pinnacle of car racing being a double tier competition (6 cars only) and the trinity Mercedes, RedBull and Ferrari. All of them are currently associated with some kind of robotic automation program. Let’s look at two facts:
        </p>

        <p>
            1. Autonomous vehicles have high speeds and narrow width resulting in the assembly line to be short.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            2. F1 vehicles are stated to be safer when compared to standard vehicles.
        </p>
        
        <p class="lastparagraph">
            There have already been predictions about developing a driverless F1 car by 2025. These would surely save from scratches and accidents but it won’t be racing anymore. Cars including radars, cameras, computers and sensors equating the weight of electronics to the weight of an average human driver are being built. They’ve reached the programming level for an amateur driver and testing with human drivers may be done. It’s a very technical yet emotional issue whether to go driver less in F1 or not, it would honestly be a real life simulation of playing with Remote controlled cars. That’s a three year jump I’m pretty curious about. It’s all still far away and are futuristic hopes which I do have complete faith in.
