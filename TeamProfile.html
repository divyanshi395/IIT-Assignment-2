    <h2>How is this useful</h2>
    
    <p class="lastparagraph">
        Personality Tests are used by organisations to get an insight on who their potential employees are. They showcase strengths and weaknesses of an individual, how they respond within team activities and if their requirements are met with their organisations benchmark. Personality tests are also used by individuals to help them understand their strengths and weaknesses and can help them understand what sort of industry they would like to work in.

        <br>
        These personality tests has given our team members some insight on their personality, how they interact, how people perceive them and most importantly how they perceive themselves. As stated previously, these tests can indicate strengths and weaknesses of a person and as such we can use this information to seek out team members who can fill in the gaps that we ourselves lack in which can improve our confidence thus improving the effort we put in as you can rely on others when needed. Many of our team members were considered auditory learners and as such we find it very helpful to listen to learn, we were unable to make many meetings due to different schedules however the ones that we did have helped us tremendously with allocating tasks and understanding where people were with the assignment which definitely increased productivity.
