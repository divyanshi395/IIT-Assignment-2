        Overall, the assignment went fairly well. We were able to produce an assignment that i would be happy with submitting, one issue that we could have improved on was communication as there was a lack of communication between team members within discord and microsoft teams channel throughout the assignment period making it difficult to get a gist on where everyone was at. Although communication was an issue, one surprising thing that came out of this assignment was mostly everyone was able to finish their part of the assignment showing that everyone understood their responsibilities and upheld their part of thee assignment which is greatly appreciated. One thing that i learned while working in this group is how important communication is.

        I think the assignment went ok, certainly could have been worse but really wasn’t the most ideal situation. There were a few of us who worked really hard to ensure the project all came together, but the others all just seemed to never communicate with us. Working with the few that did actually put in the work was great! We all got along and seemed to agree on the direction we wanted the assignment to go in. I just overall found it very tough to try and round up five very unresponsive teammates and try to get them to do their work. One thing that was surprising for me was the effort that two of my team members were willing to go along with me to make sure the whole assignment was done, which was certainly a nice surprise. Something that I learnt about groups throughout this assignment was that I do tend to take on a leadership role in group settings more so than I thought, which likely stems from the whole “if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself” mindset.
