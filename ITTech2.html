    <h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h1>

    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency refers to a digital and or virtual currency which is secured by cryptography, thus making it near impossible to counterfeit crypto, unlike currencies that deal with cash such as GDP and AUD, along with prevent double spending whilst dealing with different cryptocurrencies. A majority of the cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks in which this decentralized structure allows them to work and trade outside of the control of agencies, governments and other groups making it near impossible to interfere with or be manipulated. In addition, cryptocurrencies rely on a system known as the blockchain which can be referred to as a digital data base, in which information regarding the transactions are stored securely removing the need for a third party. Because of these two key features regarding the cryptocurrency and block chain, being both decentralized and not needing the trust of a third party it sets it apart from the modern currency system. In regards to the blockchain and cryptocurrency it already has many real world uses and is rapidly expanding despite being banned and or unavailable for use in certain regions/countries. Some of the uses include sending and receiving payments via crypto currency at low costs and high speeds, earning interest on certain cryptocurrencies through a process known as ‘Yield Farming’, cryptocurrencies can be used as an alternative storage of wealth, one in which can not be frozen by authorities or other agencies/groups, and most importantly right now cryptocurrency provides the opportunity to make anonymous transactions, anonymous meaning the sources of where the funds are coming from are kept private and where it is going, unlike normal banks in which transactions of money can be questioned or made public under certain conditions. As previously mentioned, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain have a large variety of uses in the real world however it is only just gaining traction in many countries and has a long way to go. Currently many countries and regions have a ban on the usage of cryptocurrency such as China and Pakistan to avoid the use of cryptocurrency for illegal activities. However because to many the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not something they are familiar with, within the next 3 years or near future we can expect to see traction regarding cryptocurrencies increase, meaning more people may switch from storing their money in normal banks to their own crypto wallets, more stores and ATMs may provide the ability to use crypto to purchase items/services and or take out different currencies and some areas might completely divert to the preference of using cryptocurrencies over general currencies. The technology that made the use of cryptocurrency possible all revolves around the development and expansion of the use of the internet. Because people now can access the internet via their phone, or laptop the access to knowledge and use regarding the blockchain and cryptocurrency has never been easier unlike in the past where the internet was not as advanced, and access to information and services like these were not as easy to obtain. For an example the first official cryptocurrency was launched in 1990 known as ‘DigiCash’ but because advancements in technology that revolved around the internet and access to the internet was very minimal back then almost nobody knew what cryptocurrency was let alone DigiCash. It was only due to the rapid advancement in technology that led to easier access to the internet that allowed for cryptocurrency to expand this much making it easier to purchase, use and sell. </p>

    <h2>What impact may the blockchain and cryptocurrencies have?</h2>
    <p>The rapid development in cryptocurrency may have a huge impact on the value of current currencies worldwide. Despite many countries putting in an effort to ban crypto due to its versatile usage and the countries inability to control who uses it and for what purpose, there is no foreseeing whether more and more people will continue to understand the usage of cryptocurrencies and its benefits it has over current currencies causing them to slowly switch towards it. As a result of this more of the population world wide will take up the use of cryptocurrencies and stop using current currencies as a means of transactions causing their value to plummet and eventually become worthless. An example of something like this is the situation in Venezuela, because their economy had already previously crashed this caused their currency to plummet and caused many of their wealthiest residents to store their wealth via crypto.Again, as previously mentioned the main change that will likely happen if the population switches to the use of crypto is that current currencies will lose their value and less people will use to as a means to purchase goods and services. Instead, people may begin purchasing goods, services or transact money via bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin. The people that will be most affected by this change and movement is those that do not switch to the use of cryptocurrencies or got into it too late, as the price of the currency they hold or store their wealth in plummets by the time they decide to switch it won’t be enough to be financially stable in this new economy revolving around cryptocurrency. It is hard to say whether the usage of cryptocurrencies will vacate or create new jobs or technologies as it can go either way. Job positions such as software developers may be required to create sites that allow to purchase and store crypto whilst on the other hand typical jobs like financial analysts may not be needed anymore as the crypto market is completely volatile and dependent on no group of people.  </p>

    <h2>How may the usage of cryptocurrencies affect me</h2>
    <p class="lastparagraph">The increased usage of cryptocurrency and the blockchain will affect me like it would to anyone else. I’d too fall into the benefits of the usage of cryptocurrency and use that as my main storage of wealth. Continuing my everyday life will nothing changing except the currency I use to purchase items. However, a major downside that can be created because of the anonymous aspect that cryptocurrency provides is crypto theft which can ruin numerous lives including mine if I’m not careful enough. Because cryptocurrencies are stores in wallets if not protected enough such as rising two factor authentication or hard passwords hackers and thief’s may find access to other people’s wallets and circulate them through numerous transactions so the final destination of the cryptocurrency is completely lost before reaching their account and in this case because of the privacy of the transactions and inability to access them authorities will have little to no chance finding those responsible. Dirty money can be now used as clean money, large transactions of cryptocurrency that has been obtained via illegal ways can now be made with nobody there to question the sources of it. </p>
