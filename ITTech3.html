    <h1>Robots</h1>
    <h2>What do they do?</h2>
    <p>Robots or in other words robotics refers to the intersection of both science, engineering and technology in which the three areas combined produce machines known as robots. The most basic term and or reasoning for the creation and development in robots is for it to substitute human effort and carry out tasks in a more efficient manner with a smaller margin of error, by removing the possibilities of human errors. In more complex terms the word robots its self is a programmable machine which will be used to carry out to complete a task whilst on the other hand robotics describes the filed in which there is a focus on innovating and developing more and more advanced robots. To this date as time goes on the field of robotics only further develops, expanding their usage and purpose on a global scale. Decades ago in the early 2000’s a majority of robots would be seen into the automobile industry in which their use was at the highest, using claws and mechanical arms to lift heavy metal parts and assemble the cars we knew back then, however today robots can be seen almost everywhere. This includes out of earth with robots being used by companies like NASA to explore different planets such as Mars, or being used on earth exploring the worlds harshest conditions, within caves or thousands of feet underwater. The list doesn’t stop here, it can be seen in everyday life, assisting law enforcement, being used in surgical procedures, being used by armies across the globe, and almost in nearly every factory. To say what will be able to be done with robots within the near future would be a hard take. Their purpose was to solely reduce human effort and reduce human error, meaning that the use of robots only benefits us, leading us to see and increase of their use across the globe. Within the near future, developments in robotics will lead to more and more advanced robots, with a larger range of uses putting the old ones behind in the past, left in the dirt. We can expect to see the use of robotics in our everyday life, its only the expense and time that robots require which prevents it from already being used around the world. We can expect robots to replace many human jobs too, going into cafes having robot servers that bring you your food (which already exist today), having machines that create breakfast for you (seen around many buffets across the world) or having self-driving cars which are already largely in development today. The point is that all of this will only expand, robotics is already a major field in nearly every well-developed country on earth and every well-developed company, once we go into the future, more time will be spent within the field creating more and more advancements robots and possibly reducing their costs which is the biggest factor that prevents the use of robots within many poor countries right now. What made the advancements and expansion of robots possible was the large array of companies that specialize in the development of robotics. Like any other field developments are bound to happen with time and money, but because of the benefits that robots bring to people and companies across the globe, it’s a field everybody wants to focus on and spend money and time on making advancements and expansion of robotics bound to happen on a global scale. </p>

    <h2>What impact do they have?</h2>
    <p>The main potential impact that robots will have will be a positive one as previously mentioned before their main purpose is to reduce human effort and errors. This means in almost any industry that robots are used in there will be less manufacturing errors, production errors and sale errors, only positively impacting the company and or people using it. Because of robots what is likely to change is the focus on other fields, because of the benefits robots bring more people and companies will divert their time, effort and money to focus on the field of robotics. current jobs or technologies?
However, because of robots and vast developments in robotics the people that will be affected the most are those who have jobs in which can be easily replaced by robots. This includes things such as servers which can be replaced by robot servers, delivery drivers which can be replaced by robotic machines that deliver the food and taxi drivers which can be replaced with self-driving cars. What makes this more fearful to society is that a lot of these things are happening today and can be seen across the world. Many people are losing jobs within factories and being replaced by machines, and those who can keep humans in factories for cheap costs will continue to do until the benefits robots bring outweigh its costly price. Because of this its only a matter of time before more and more jobs become replaceable causing robots to take current jobs however then again like every advancement in technology there will always be employment opportunities too, employment opportunities within the field of robotics. Therefore, despite taking jobs it will ultimately create them too.  </p>

<h2>How will the use of robots affect me</h2>
<p class="lastparagraph"> In terms of my daily life the use of robots and advancements in robotics will only make my life easier. It may go unnoticed, and it may be simple everyday tasks that become easier, but in the long run will be appreciated by society. As seen today, rather than waiting in line for a cashier I could save my self-time and go to the self-serve check out or instead of making coffee for my self id be waiting around for the machine to complete it. Because of this almost nothing in my daily life will change except how I may carry out a few certain tasks such as shopping or eating which because of robots will only become easier and less of a hassle for me. This goes for the same for my family and friends. The use of robotics will affect their life very little but in the way it does it’ll only be a positive impact rather than negative. </p>
